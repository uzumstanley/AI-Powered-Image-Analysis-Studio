## Code Walkthrough

### Page Configuration

The app is set up with a custom theme using Streamlit's `set_page_config` method, providing a wide layout and a custom title and icon.

```python
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Gemini Vision Pro",
    page_icon="üîÆ",
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded"
)
```

### Sidebar with Information

The sidebar includes basic information about the app and its features, along with a footer indicating the app's creators.

```python
with st.sidebar:
    st.title("üîÆ Gemini Vision Pro")
    st.markdown("---")
    st.subheader("About")
    st.markdown("""
        Transform your images into insights with Gemini Vision Pro - powered by Google's 
        advanced gemini-2.0-flash-exp model for lightning-fast image analysis.
    """)
    st.markdown("---")
    st.caption("Powered by Gemini AI 2.0")
```

### Image Upload and Analysis

The user uploads an image, which is processed by Gemini AI. The user can also input a query about the image.

```python
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader(
    "Upload Image (JPEG/PNG)",
    type=["jpg", "jpeg", "png"],
    help="Drag and drop or click to upload"
)

if st.button("üîç Analyze with Gemini AI", key="analyze"):
    # Image and query processing
    response = get_gemini_response(detailed_prompt, image_data, input_prompt)
    st.success("‚ú® Analysis Complete!")
    st.markdown("### üìä Analysis Results")
    st.markdown(response)
```

### Custom Styling

Custom CSS is applied to improve the user interface, such as customizing button styles, input fields, and image display.

```python
st.markdown("""
    <style>
    .main {
        padding: 2rem;
    }
    .stButton>button {
        width: 100%;
        border-radius: 10px;
        height: 3rem;
        background-color: #FF4B4B;
        color: white;
        font-weight: bold;
    }
    .uploadedImage {
        border-radius: 10px;
        box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    }
    .stTextArea>div>div>textarea {
